"Make no mistake about it: WordPress has the easiest interface (as compared to most other CMSs). Furthermore, it also has many plugins and themes that can help you customise your website even if you are not comfortable with code and Web development. In fact, WordPress has the shallowest learning curve of all the three CMSs under review."

GitHub (for collaborations) Looks likes this will help us understand how (!) we can collaborate (version control, etc.) Explains simply how git and github work:

What about https://gitorious.org/ ???? Is this easier than github or altogether different?
(looks like less control by collaborators and PRICE are downsides...)

url

"Uniform (or universal) Resource Locator, the address of a World Wide Web page"

php

from PHP for Dummies  

@www.http://mazinscott.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/PHP-for-Dummies.pdf

"PHP is a widely used open source, general-purpose scripting language. It was
originally designed for use in Web site development. In fact, PHP started life
as Personal Home Page tools, developed by Rasmus Lerdorf to assist users
with Web page tasks. PHP proved so useful and popular, it rapidly grew to
become the full-featured language that it is today, acquiring the name PHP
Hypertext Preprocessor along the way to represent its expanded abilities ó
processing Web pages before theyíre displayed."

....

"PHP is a server-side scripting language, which means that the scripts are executed
on the server (the computer where the Web site is located). This is different
than JavaScript, another popular language for dynamic Web sites. JavaScript
is executed by the browser, on the userís computer. Thus, JavaScript is a clientside
language..."

ssh

wiki definition:

Secure Shell (SSH) is a network protocol for secure data communication,
remote shell services or command execution and other secure network
services between two networked computers that it connects via a secure
channel over an insecure network: a server and a client (running SSH
server and SSH client programs, respectively).[1] The protocol
specification distinguishes two major versions that are referred to as
SSH-1 and SSH-2.

Definition of Front-end and Back-end in Development: (quora.com)

Backend development means the part of the system that isn't user
facing: the databases, big algorithms, etc. In the modern day that
usually means a server.

Frontend development is the part that users see and interact with. That
includes the UI, the animations, and usually a bunch of logic to talk to
the backend. In the modern day that can mean an app running on your
iPhone or the HTML and Javascript in a web browser.

If you use the metaphor of a car you can think of the frontend developer
as the guy who installs the leather seats, steering wheel, pedals,
shifters, and the stereo. The backend developer is the guy who puts in
the engine and the transmission.'

What is a Server:

http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/server.html

A "web server" delivers content.  Apache is the most popular and widely used HTTP server...

What is Web Hosting:

http://www.techterms.com/definition/webhost

What is a Web Builder:

Templates already designed and set up for your use.  Web Hosts offer services too. 
examples: 
godaddy.com  
wordpress.

There are fees for many of these, payable upfont.  
Some even GIVE you a registered domain name included in their packages.

When selecting your unique domain name, consider SEO (Search Engine Optimization)

What is 'whois'?

I think it can be likened to a world wide yellow pages directory.  In this sense, your domain can easily be found, which is great. BUT, it may expose your website to spam and some other undesired attacks. So, is privacy a hindrance or a help? 

Whois is a premium service, much like paying an additional fee for an unlisted telephone number.
